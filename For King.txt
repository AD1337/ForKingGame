-things that get away from you when you get closer to them.


VISUALS
	-blurred background
	-windy (cloud like speech balloon for mayas) cursor, pointing to the cursor target pixel.
	-intro: king starts in the top of a castle, crown on his head. The wind blows it away and it falls down (physics) all the way down the steps. The player takes control and goes on to get the crown.

MECHANICS
	-move the king by using the mouse to control wind.
	-move with <-, -> and A D.

-you can prototype this game with what you have so far. Drag objects to simulate wind or something. Is this really the game you want?
-for king's sake, make a fucking mockup.
-on your path to have it all (even the crown), you end up losing it all. But in losing it all, you gain it all. Then you have not just a cape, a scepter and a crown: you have nothing, and by having nothing you have everything (the trees, the leaves, the wind, the water).

WORDS
	-"On the King's path to have all, he has lost all."
	-"But in losing all, he has gained all."

PITCH

	-A relaxing platformer with physics puzzles.
	-A relaxing puzzle platformer with physics.
	-2D Puzzle platformer with physics.
	-2D platformer about a king's journey.
	-You are a king in search for your lost crown.
	-A king in search for his lost crown.

-Platformer with physics puzzles, relaxing atmosphere and existentialist/philosophical message.

-Sensorial, it's about the king leaving his ivory tower and experience things: touch, sound, visuals, anger, despair, ambition, joy, pity, compassion, lonelyness, and losing his pride in favor of all these.
-A game about a king that loses his crown and goes on a journey to recover it. But the world turns out to be far more dangerous than the safety of his castle, and he ends up losing everything else: his scepter, his coat, his shoes. Though he loses all material possessions, he learns a valuable lesson.
-Unlike other games, it's not about gaining things and reaching the castle in the end. You leave the castle right at the beginning, and lose everything in your journey.
-It's not about becoming a king, it's about abandoning everything and, in doing so, gaining it all.

-the game comes to a point where you can't push things anymore, you are weak. Then you can't jump anymore, you are tired. You can only walk, you are powerless.
-Or there is an obstacle that you just can't go through, an obstacle too heavy for you to push.

LEVEL IDEAS
	-"Basic Platforming"
	-"Domino": domino blocks, you hit one and all others fall in chain, letting you reach the end.
	-"Be quick": falling block
	-"In the way": rock in the way
	-"Mind the gap": hole must be filled with a wagon wheel so you can pass.
	-"Bridge": push the lever to bring down the elevated bridge so you can go right.
	-"Freezing Child" give coat (press up). Once you give it, you can take the coat back by pressing down. If you leave the kid without it, he dies.]
	-"Catapult Yourself"
	-"Catapult to Destroy"
	-"Juggle Walking" above a circle to avoid spikes below, or to be higher up and be able to jump on other side
	-"Wall jumping"
	-"Slipery" reduce friction of some platforms.
	-"Gravity" fucked up gravity
	-"Wind" wind left to right, right to left.
	-"Begging" a level in which you can beg to have your scepter back, but the guy just shakes his head "no no no". Nothing you can do. First you order him to return it, then you beg. He says no both times, and there's nothing you can do.
	-"Twin levels" -> things are being thrown from the right, you find out there's a catapult there when you go on the next screen.

	-"The Ascetic" (Monk) ----> all these are in the palace still

	-"The Indulgent"
